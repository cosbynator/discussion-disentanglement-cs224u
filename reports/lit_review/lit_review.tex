\section{Introduction}
Our project is focused on reconstructing threaded conversation trees
from a flattened representation. Intuitively, one could think of 
taking a site like reddit's comment tree, flattening it, sorting by time, performing
hierarchical clustering using linguistic phenomena and measuring performance against the original comment trees. As we have
discovered, this project treads into the territory of \textit{discourse disentanglement}.
Although our approach appears to be unique, there has been a reasonable
amount of prior work in constructing a sane flow of conversation within internet chat.

\section{Literature Review}
\subsection{Reconstruction of threaded conversations in online discussion forums}
In \cite{Aumayr2011a}, we found the closest paper to our project goal.
